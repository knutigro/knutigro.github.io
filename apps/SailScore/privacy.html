<h2> Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We collect SailScore app diagnostics and crash reports. This will help us to help you.</p>
<p>
We only use this information to help fix crashes and to understand how people use the app. We won&#8217;t share it with anyone else.
</p>

<h3>About this Policy</h3>
We want you to get the most from SailScore. To do that we collect some information about your usage. This policy describes what we collect, and how we will (and won’t) use that information.
<h3>Information about crashes and usage</h3>
<p>We work very hard to keep crashes to an absolute minimum. If your app crashes we want to know about it, so we can find the problem and fix it. We also like to know which features people use, so we know which ones to enhance.</p>
<p>
We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect:
<ul>
 	<li>Crashlytics Installation UUIDs (Unique Identifiers)</li>
 	<li>Crash Traces</li>
 	<li>Information about usage of app features</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>How it helps: </b>Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack traces to associate crashes with a project, send email alerts to us and display them in the Firebase Console, and help us debug crashes. It uses Crashlytics Installation UUIDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash.</p>

<p><b>Retention: </b>Firebase Crashlytics retains crash stack traces, and associated identifiers (including Crashlytics Installation UUIDs) for 90 days.</p>

<p><b>Privacy: </b>Under normal circumstances we won’t identify individual users or devices. If you contact us for help, we may ask you for additional information to help us identify which crash came from your device. But that would be your choice.</p>

<p>We will not use information collected to send you promotional material.</p>
